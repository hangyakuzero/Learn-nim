# Learn nim

created so that i can try out some stuff while documenting my journey of learning nim


## what you need to know
the things one needs to know to pick up a programming language is fairly simple, you'll need to build actual projects at the end of the day to actually learn the "programming" part, so after you learn these things, think of something you want to build and go ahead and build it.

Note: use AI only when you are stuck
so the things are
 * Types
 * Data Structure
 * Loops
 * String Methods
 * Flow Control(if, else, while)
 * FIle Handling
 * Handling user input, both command line args and during runtime
 And that's it, now in order to learn all of this you need to get your hands dirty and actually write code and mess around.
## Things I want to add
 * making requests to urls, crawling, etc.
  I belive nim can be used to create fun but powerful cybersecurity projects.
